# Data Preprocessing Project

This repository contains a complete data preprocessing workflow implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The project focuses on preparing raw data for analysis and machine learning by applying essential cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering techniques.

# File Included

Data Preprocessing.ipynb — Notebook containing all cleaning and preprocessing steps.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to clean and transform a raw dataset into a structured and analysis-ready format. The notebook covers all major preprocessing tasks required for data analytics and machine learning pipelines.

# Key Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values (mean/median/mode, removal where required)

Removing duplicates

Detecting and correcting inconsistencies

Fixing incorrect data types

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Data distribution checks

Identifying outliers

Understanding categorical and numerical features

3. Feature Engineering

Creating new derived features

Binning and grouping

Encoding categorical variables

One-Hot Encoding

Label Encoding

4. Data Transformation

Scaling numerical features

Normalization / Standardization

Log transformation for skewed data

Handling imbalanced data (if applicable)

5. Final Output

Fully processed dataset ready for model training or visualization
